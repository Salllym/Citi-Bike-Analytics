# Citi-Bike-Analytics
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program in New York City has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month the bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

# Objective
The goal of this project is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a data dashboard. The timespan that is used for this data is the year 2017.
